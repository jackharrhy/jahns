# Jahns

A game for a gamejam.

This codebase was previously [tictac](https://github.com/jackharrhy/tictac), but then the tictac core was ripped out,
and replaced with the logic here.

To start the Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Then visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
